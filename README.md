# IIITB-LinearRegression-Bike-CaseStudy
Project Overview
This project entails the development of a predictive model using multiple linear regression to forecast the demand for shared bicycles. 


Background of the Project
BoomBikes, a prominent bike-sharing company based in the United States, has faced significant revenue losses owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is grappling with the economic uncertainty that the crisis has imposed, struggling to maintain financial sustainability in the current market.
In response, BoomBikes is working on a strategic business plan aimed at rejuvenating their revenue streams once the pandemic-induced restrictions are lifted and normal economic activities resume. The company is particularly focused on forecasting bike rental demand post-lockdown to better align their services with the evolving needs of the population.

Business Challenge Addressed
The primary objective is to build a model that predicts the demand for shared bikes based on a set of independent variables. This model will be instrumental for BoomBikes' management team to gain insights into the key factors that influence bike rental demand, enabling them to tailor their business strategies accordingly. Moreover, the model will offer valuable insights for the company to effectively enter new markets and optimize its operations.
Summary of Insights
Temperature (temp): Temperature emerges as the most influential factor in determining the demand for bike rentals, with demand increasing markedly as temperatures rise.
Year (yr): The year variable shows a positive correlation with demand, reflecting a consistent growth trend in bike rentals over the years.
Winter Season (winter): The winter season appears to drive higher demand, likely due to factors like recreational activities and the holiday season.
September (Sep): Demand spikes notably in September, indicating that the month is associated with higher rental activity.
Saturday (Sat): Saturdays demonstrate an uptick in demand, suggesting that weekends see more frequent bike rentals.
Working Day (workingday): Demand remains high during working days, likely due to the bikes being used for commuting purposes.
Mist (Mist): Misty weather conditions have a negative effect on bike rental demand, with rentals dipping on misty days.
December (Dec): December shows a decline in demand, likely attributed to colder weather and the holiday season.
November (Nov): November exhibits a similar downward trend, with lower demand correlating with the approach of winter and dropping temperatures.
Windspeed (windspeed): High wind speeds are associated with reduced demand for bikes, as adverse weather conditions deter potential riders.
